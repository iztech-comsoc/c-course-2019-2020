// We all know we have a formula to find roots of a quadratic equation.
// Use basic mathematical operators and sqrt function from math.h, then find the roots of quadratic equation a*x^2 + b*x + c.
// Use the formula (+-b  + (sqrt(delta)))/2*a, where delta = b*b - 4*a*c and a, b & c are the coefficents of the equation.
