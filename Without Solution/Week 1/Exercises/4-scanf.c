#include <stdio.h>

/*
When a character is entered by the user in the last program, the character itself is not stored. 
Instead, an integer value (ASCII value) is stored.

And when we display that value using %c text format, the entered character is displayed. 
If we use %d to display the character, it's ASCII value is printed.

Use the same basic scanf printf format but this time, print the character with %d to see the ascii value.
