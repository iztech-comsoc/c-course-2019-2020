// There is an operator called terniary that everyone forgets. :(
// Lets use terniary operator to find which number is bigger without using if keyword.
// Terniary operator is closely related to if-else-else if statement.
// (condition) ? expression1 : expression2    If the condition is true then expression1 is returned, otherwise expression2 is returned.
// Take two numbers, use terniary operator, store the biggest one and print it.
