// There is a formula that calculates the area of a triangle given it�s three sides. But its hard to evaluate with pen and paper.
// Use basic mathematical operators and find the area of triangle with a,b,c sides.
// The formula or algorithm used is: Area = sqrt(s(s � a)(s � b)(s � c)), where s = (a + b + c) / 2 or perimeter / 2. and a, b & c are the sides of triangle
