/*
    145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.
    Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.

    Note: as 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums. they are not included.

    Hint: you can start by determining upper limit like this:
	  9...9 > 9! * n	(n is digit cound)
    Note: you are free to create new functions.
